# Revised Eulogos Development Specification

## 1. Introduction

Eulogos is a specialized application for exploring ancient Greek texts with a primary focus on enabling advanced relational data storage, vector embeddings, and semantic analysis. While the system provides a public viewer for texts, this is a secondary benefit—filling a gap in current text accessibility—rather than the core purpose. This specification outlines a pragmatic, lightweight development approach that prioritizes these research goals without overbuilding infrastructure for a low-traffic scholarly tool.
