# Obsolete Catalog Generator

The files in this directory are the previous implementation of the catalog generator for Eulogos.
They have been replaced by the canonical catalog builder at `app/scripts/canonical_catalog_builder.py`.

These files are kept for historical reference only and should not be used in production.

## Replacement

The canonical catalog builder is now the single source of truth for generating the integrated catalog.
It provides a more robust, maintainable, and efficient implementation that properly handles all edge cases.

See `app/scripts/README.md` for documentation on the new canonical catalog builder.
