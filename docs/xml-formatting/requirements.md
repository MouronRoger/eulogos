# Eulogos Text Formatting and Export Requirements

## Overview

The Eulogos project requires enhanced XML text formatting and multi-format export capabilities to make ancient Greek texts accessible for both online reading and offline use. This document outlines the specific requirements for implementing these features.

## 1. XML Formatting Requirements

### 1.1 Text Structure Preservation

- Maintain hierarchical structure of ancient texts (books, chapters, sections)
- Preserve paragraph and line breaks
- Maintain poetry line numbering and alignment
- Support nested elements (quotes, notes, references)
- Handle specialized TEI XML elements common in ancient texts

### 1.2 Reference Handling

- Parse and display hierarchical references (e.g., 1.1.5 for book.chapter.verse)
- Enable navigation between adjacent references
- Support citation and linking to specific text passages
- Extract and display reference metadata

### 1.3 Display Formatting

- Apply appropriate typography for ancient Greek texts
- Support token-level interactions for word analysis
- Maintain emphasis, italics, and other text styling
- Properly render specialized symbols and characters
- Display line numbers for poetry and verse texts

## 2. Export Functionality Requirements

### 2.1 Supported Export Formats

- PDF with proper typesetting and page layout
- ePub for e-readers and mobile devices
- Markdown for plain text editing and compatibility
- DOCX (Word) for academic and publishing workflows

### 2.2 Export Features

- Include document metadata (title, author, publisher)
- Generate table of contents for navigation
- Apply consistent typography and styling
- Preserve Greek characters and diacritical marks
- Include proper page breaks and section divisions
- Support customizable options for each format

### 2.3 User Interface

- Provide intuitive export options within the reader interface
- Allow format selection and customization
- Offer feedback for long-running export operations
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Code Structure

- Implement a modular, maintainable codebase
- Follow existing project architecture patterns
- Provide comprehensive documentation
- Include appropriate error handling

### 3.2 Performance

- Optimize for large documents
- Efficiently process complex XML structures
- Handle asynchronous operations for long-running exports
- Minimize memory usage for large texts

### 3.3 Compatibility

- Ensure Unicode compatibility for Greek text
- Support modern browsers and devices
- Generate standards-compliant output files
- Maintain accessibility standards

## 4. Implementation Approach

The implementation should follow the Reference Handling System approach outlined in the `xml_reference-handling-implementation.md` document, which provides a comprehensive solution for TEI XML processing with support for:

- Hierarchical reference extraction
- Token-level processing
- Advanced HTML transformation
- Navigation between references

This foundation should be extended with export capabilities that leverage the enhanced XML processing to generate high-quality exports in various formats.

## 5. Expected Deliverables

1. Enhanced XMLProcessorService with reference handling capabilities
2. URN model for text identification and navigation
3. ExportService with support for multiple formats
4. API endpoints for text export
5. UI components for export options
6. Comprehensive test suite
7. Documentation and implementation guide

## 6. Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. TEI XML texts are properly formatted and readable in the browser
2. References are properly extracted and navigable
3. Exports maintain proper formatting and structure in all supported formats
4. The user interface provides intuitive access to export functionality
5. Performance is acceptable for large texts
6. All test cases pass successfully
