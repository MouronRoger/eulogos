# Eulogos TEI XML Reader Implementation Package

## Overview

This implementation package fixes the issue where the Eulogos reader is showing raw XML with no styling, instead of properly formatted TEI XML content with scholarly features. This package includes:

1. **Enhanced XML Processor** - A comprehensive upgrade to XMLProcessorService with proper TEI element handling
2. **TEI CSS Styles** - Sophisticated styling for TEI elements including Greek text, notes, and references
3. **Updated Reader Template** - An improved HTML template with interactive features and reference navigation
4. **Test XML Sample** - A sample TEI XML file for testing the implementation
5. **Implementation Guide** - Detailed instructions for implementing the solution

## Problem Identified

The current implementation has several issues:

1. XMLProcessorService's `_process_element_to_html()` method is generating overly simplified HTML that doesn't match the CSS selectors in the reader template
2. The method doesn't properly handle specialized TEI elements like footnotes, line breaks, page breaks, etc.
3. Greek text isn't being properly tokenized for word-level analysis and styling

## Solution

The enhanced implementation:

1. Properly processes TEI XML elements with appropriate HTML structure
2. Creates HTML that matches the CSS selectors in the reader template
3. Properly tokenizes Greek text for word-level analysis and interaction
4. Handles scholarly features like critical apparatus, line numbers, and page breaks

## Implementation Steps

1. Replace app/services/xml_processor.py with the enhanced implementation provided in eulogos-xml-processor-fix.py
2. Update the CSS styles in app/templates/reader.html with those from eulogos-tei-css.css
3. Update the reader HTML template with the improved version from eulogos-reader-html-template.html
4. Test with sample TEI XML data from eulogos-test-xml-sample.xml
